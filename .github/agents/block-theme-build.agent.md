# Block Theme Build Agent Spec

This document defines the specification for the `block-theme-build.agent.js` automation agent, responsible for managing the build, lint, and test lifecycle of a WordPress block theme. It is tightly integrated with the repository's workflows and follows best practices from the official WordPress theme build process documentation.

---

## Purpose
- Automate the build, lint, test, and validation process for a block theme.
- Ensure all code changes are validated against WordPress and org standards before merging or deployment.
- Provide a consistent, reproducible build and test process for local and CI/CD environments.

## Key References
- [Main Agent Index](./agent.md)
- [WordPress Theme Build Process](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/build-process/)
- [@wordpress/scripts Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/)

---

## Build Process Overview
1. **Install**: Ensure all required dependencies are installed (`npm ci`).
2. **Lint**: Run all linters (JS, CSS, PHP) and fail on any errors.
3. **Build**: Use `@wordpress/scripts` and custom webpack config to build assets.
4. **Test**: Run all tests (Jest, Playwright, PHPunit, etc.).
5. **Report**: Output a summary of all steps, errors, and next actions.

## Environment Variables
- `DRY_RUN`: If true, only print steps without executing them.
- `VERBOSE`: If true, print detailed logs for each step.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For workflow and label operations (if needed).

---

## Maintenance & Best Practices
- Keep this spec in sync with the [WordPress Theme Build Process](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/build-process/).
- Update the agent and this spec as new best practices or requirements emerge.
- Ensure all contributors are aware of this spec and reference it in PRs and workflow changes.
